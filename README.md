Slides for FOSS4G 2014
=================

If you would like to add your slides to the repo, please name them with "Presentation Name — Author(s).pdf" and issue a pull request. They need not be PDFs, though obviously portable formats are preferred.

If you have web-based or other slides which you would prefer to link to rather than include directly, please create a Markdown file, "Presentation Name — Author(s).md", and include the link. See the file "00 An Example Talk - Some Author.md" for an example.
